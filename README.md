# Signatures

Utilities for assessing Python function signature equality and compatibility,
with the latter accounting for subtypes (including Generics!)

## Examples
See the [test suite](/tests/test_signatures.py) for a full set of examples.

### Equality
```python
# Identical function signatures are equal.
import signatures

def foo(thing: Any) -> None:
    pass

def bar(thing: Any) -> None:
    pass

assert signatures.equal(foo, bar)
```
```python
# Different function signatures are not equal.
import signatures

def foo(eggs: Any) -> None:
    pass

def bar(cheese: Any) -> None:
    pass

assert not signatures.equal(foo, bar)
```

### Compatibility
```python
# A function signature is compatible with a more
# generic function signature.
from typing import TypeVar

import signatures

T = TypeVar("T", bound=int)

def foo(thing: bool) -> None:
    pass

def bar(thing: T) -> None:
    pass

assert signatures.compatible(foo, bar)
```
```python
# Compatibility checks support nested Generic types.
import signatures

def foo(thing: List[Tuple[bool, str]]) -> None:
    pass

def bar(thing: List[Tuple[int, str]]) -> None:
    pass

assert signatures.compatible(foo, bar)
```
```python
# A function signature is not compatible when
# Generic types are not compatible.
import signatures

def foo(thing: List[int]) -> None:
    pass

def bar(thing: List[Tuple[int, str]]) -> None:
    pass

assert not signatures.compatible(foo, bar)
```
